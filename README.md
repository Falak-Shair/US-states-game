# US-states-game
# Skills Gained:
In this project I have learned about how to work with CSV files, so not just text files. But I'm going to be working with data files and I'm going to be analyzing that data with a library called Pandas.
This is one of the most popular Python data analysis libraries and I'm going to get grips with how we can use it with the help of this project.
# Project Detail:
I'm going to be building a educational and interesting game, where it has a map of all the States of U.S, it's all blank until you start guessing some States,and then you keep going until you've managed to get all 50.
for example if I go and add another state and I hit OK, then that name appears on the map at the location of the state.
The aim of the game is to remember all of the names of the states and to name as many of them as you can.

In this screenshoot I've guessed 28/50 which show on the top of pop-up bar. All 28 states which I've guessed appear on the map at the location of the state.
